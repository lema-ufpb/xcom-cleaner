## Prerequisites

Tools:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)

---

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Best Practices

- Never save sensitive credential data in GitLab (even if encrypted).
- Review code and apply linting before pushing.
- Use the task or feature code in the commit message. Ex: `git commit -m "task/01: message ..."`.
- Open a merge request to the `main` branch and request a reviewer.

## üì¶ Test Environment

- Agile Development

In VSCode, execute tests in **Airflow via command line** using the F5 key. Tasks have been configured in the `.vscode` directory for pre-checking the Docker environment for local execution of the data pipeline.

- Access the Airflow Webserver at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
